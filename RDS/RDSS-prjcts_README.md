# RDSS Related Projects - Parking Space

This Parking Space contains

- instructions  
- files  
- Anything else needed  

by **RDSS Admins** and Possibly **Users**, to be able to setup and replicate some installations, but most importantly to allow Users and Clients to successfully install, test, run and operate tools and services as they have requested.


### Projects and Installations  

##### EGA-client custom :  


This Project folder contains instruction files that a User may run to replicate the initial environment setup, to be able to run `pyEGA_client` tool on RDS Systems.  

Its installation and setup is performed via `miniconda` (and at need by using `VIrtualEnv` ).

Suggested User workflow :

- follow the guide `00_RDSS_miniconda_install.md` (miniconda installation).  

- log out from the system and log back in (this will correctly re-initialize your shell).  

- follow the guide `01_pyEGA_setup_EASY.md` (for an easy installation of pyEGA) and test the tool's basic functionality.    

- in case the easy installation of pyEGA is not successful, try the alternative installation method guide `02_pyEGA_setup_ALTERNATIVE.md` or just skip this point.

- search for the term `video` in the guide `03_UserAccess.md` and watch the reference video on how to use the tool (if needed)

- follow the guide `03_UserAccess.md` to setup custom User access via credentials file or better interactively.
